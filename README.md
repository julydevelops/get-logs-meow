A simmple fullstack application to retrieve logs from a server

## Prerequisites

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/get-logs-meow.git
   cd get-logs-meow
   ```

2. Depending on whether you want to work in the frontend or backend, you can
  change directories into which ever one.

    ```bash
    cd backend/frontend
    ```

3. There are common steps to be taking before you enter into local development or testing for each.

    * Run nvm to install the correct node version
    
      ```bash
      nvm use
      ```

      If you do not have nvm, you can install it with 
      
      ```bash 
      brew install nvm
      ```
    
      If you dont have HomeBrew, thats another problem all together!

    * Install dependencies 
      ```bash 
      npm i
      ```
